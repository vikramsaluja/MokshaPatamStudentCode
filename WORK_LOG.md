| April 5 |    9-10pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                            I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Sept 3  |   2:30-3pm    |                                     I began thinking about how to approach the problem and trying to understand the game more. I went between thinking about begining the problem from the start vs at the end and then working down. |
| Sept 3  |  7:15-7:50pm  |                                                                    At this point I do not think that starting at one end will particularly make a difference. I have now began to think about use BFS and queues to solve this puzzle |
| Sept 4  |  7:45-8:15pm  |                                                                                                                  I began to write psudocode to attempt to solve the puzzle using BFS. I am stuck on how to handle the ladders portion |
| Sept 9  | 11:35-11:55am |                                                           I began to start and turn some of my psudocode into real code. I did not get very far, but I intialized some of the variables at the got the actual coding portion started. |
| Sept 10 | 5:30 - 6:15pm |                                                                                                                                            I focused on setting up the BFS and used int layout[] as a map to look up certain squares. |
| Sept 10 | 7:25 - 7:50pm | I completed the BFS loop by simulating each dice roll and its outcome. I hit an index out of bounds bug that I had to to with my for loop paramenters which I had to fix as well. I was able to complete puzzle and pass the checks.  |
