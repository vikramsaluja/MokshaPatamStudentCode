| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                        I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| Sept 3  |  2:30-3pm   | I began thinking about how to approach the problem and trying to understand the game more. I went between thinking about begining the problem from the start vs at the end and then working down. |
| Sept 3  | 7:15-7:50pm |                                At this point I do not think that starting at one end will particularly make a difference. I have now began to think about use BFS and queues to solve this puzzle |
| Sept 4  | 7:45-8:15pm |                                                                              I began to write psudocode to attempt to solve the puzzle using BFS. I am stuck on how to handle the ladders portion |
| Sept 9  | 11:35-11:55 |                       I began to start and turn some of my psudocode into real code. I did not get very far, but I intialized some of the variables at the got the actual coding portion started. |
